 Question (Slightly Challenging):
Create a controller named ProductController.
It should have a function show($id) that:

Accepts a product ID from the URL

Looks up a fake list of products (you can hardcode an array)

If product found, return its name

If not found, return “Product not found”


Question 2: Real-world Logic Challenge
Create a MarksController with a method called result($marks).

The method should:

Accept marks from the URL (like /marks/72)

Based on the marks, return a grade:

90 and above: Grade A

75–89: Grade B

50–74: Grade C

Below 50: Fail

If marks are greater than 100 or less than 0, return “Invalid Marks”
